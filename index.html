        <p class="lead mb-4">Growing up, my dad was always involved in real estate and had a strong passion for it. I was exposed to his profession and ended up wanting to follow in his footsteps as I grew older. During my high school years, I spend numerous hours learning about the ins and outs of real estate and the different types of it; Ex. industrial, commercial, and residential. The type of real estate that got me interested the most was industrial but I still wanted to partake in residential real estate as it gave me a sense of identity and helped me become my own realtor. Eventually, I collected enough time during my summers and started helping my dad and going to conventions with him as well as his conferences. I gained more exposure to real estate and fell further in love with the profession of real estate.<br><br>

        During the last two years of high school, I decided to stop following in my dadâ€™s footsteps and attempted to be independent. Or at least an independent realtor. I worked hard and studied for hours on end to obtain my real estate license. I spent time working and working on my 16-course online real estate and eventually, the work paid off and I took my first and only real estate exam. A two-day long exam to test my skill and knowledge on the topic of real estate and if I was able to prove that I knew enough, I would be rewarded with my real estate license. When the exam came to an end, I waited a few weeks to know my result. In the days following all I could do was wait for the result and when I found out, I let out a sigh of relief knowing I finally got my real estate license. All my hard work studying and researching paid off and I was able to sell and buy houses on my own.<br><br>

        During the last summer of my senior year of high school, I interned for an industrial real estate firm called IRG (Industrial Realty Group) where I learned about industrial real estate. I had already gained experience and information about residential real estate through my own work and craft but I was yet to be experienced in the field of industrial real estate. Here, I was able to have a wide range of coworkers working with me in different fields. I had people who worked in real estate law, a real estate analyst, and a real estate senior associate. Altogether, I was able to learn about different forms and fields of real estate and was able to expand my knowledge. I had worked at IRG for about 5 months and I can say that I wasnâ€™t able to gain as much knowledge and experience as I did without the help of my coworkers. Before interning with IRG, I had a very general idea of what real estate was. But after working my time during the summer, I learned that real estate isn't just about selling houses. Itâ€™s about making connections too.
